    >This essentially represents the lifecycle (or "Kill Chain") of an incident. Indicators will likely be associated with one-or-more phases of the attack, depending on what the indicator represents.  In general, the most common ordering is of [Reconnaissance --&gt; Weaponization --&gt; Delivery --&gt; Exploit --&gt; C2 --&gt; AttackerObjectives]. These phases do not always occur in a linear fashion, some may occur in parrallel, some may be interchanged, and some may be skipped all together.&#xD;
